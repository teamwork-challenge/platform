#Caesar cipher with shift=1
#Caesar cipher with random shift
#Morse Code 
#Affine Cipher with given encoding function(from previous level)
#Affine Cipher without encoding function(Since there are only
m×φ(m) possible keys (for m=26, that’s 26×12=312), brute force is feasible.)
#use decoded code from previous task to decode new answer
