# Caesar cipher with shift=1
# Caesar cipher with random shift
# Morse Code 
# Affine Cipher with given encoding function (from previous level)
# Affine Cipher without encoding function 
Since there are only m×φ(m) possible keys (for m=26, that’s 26×12=312), brute force is feasible.
# use decoded code from previous task to decode new answer  
# Huffman coding
I give a string with only lower english letters.
Student gives me answer in this format:
4
d 000
c 001
a 1
b 01
1011001101100010110011011
checks conditions:
Binary — consists only of 0  and 1  
Optimal — minimizes the number of bits in the encoded text.
Prefix — no code for a character is a prefix of the code for another character.
