# 1 Vision & Goals

Freshman CS and SE students arrive with limited experience working in teams or on codebases larger than a single file. We want to create an intensive, game-like programming challenge that immerses them in real collaboration so they learn teamwork by doing.

The goal of this project is to create a software platform for hosting such challenges, 
and the tasks-set for the first challenge.

## Teamwork elements practiced

- Task distribution and work decomposition  
- Git-based collaboration and code integration  
- Working with uncertainty, incomplete specs, and error handling  
- Identifying and mitigating technical risks

## Key ideas

- The challenge runs in 4-hour rounds that feel like mini-hackathons.  
- Each round contains several task types; teams must split work accordingly.  
- Task variants are generated on the fly, nudging students to automate repeated steps.  
- Statements are intentionally incomplete, so students experiment, document discoveries, and share knowledge.  
- Later tasks require integrating earlier solutions, reinforcing Git workflow and shared code ownership.  
- Structured retrospectives after every round prompt teams to analyze and improve their process.  
- The overall vibe is energetic and fun, so students finish with the thrill of having shipped something together.

## Success indicators

- High number of tasks solved per team by the end of the challenge  
- Commit history shows contributions from most or all team members  
- Post-round surveys report increased confidence in teamwork skills and a positive experience  
- Retrospective notes capture concrete, constructive ideas for process improvement

## Scope

### In Scope

- Development of a software platform to host programming teamwork challenges.
- Design and creation of tasks for the first challenge: 
  - 4 rounds.
  - ~10 task types.
  - ~5 levels of difficulty of each task.

### Out of Scope

- Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS).
- Development of a mobile version of the platform.
- Support for offline or in-person retrospective sessions.
- Instructions for students, hosts of the challenge and retrospectives.


## Stakeholders
